Basically, a split Diagonal slider is a slider which left and right side moves to the opposite direction. For instance, the left side moves rightwards and the right side reveals itself from below. Of course, the two sides meet in the middle of the slider. The split Diagonal slider effect is gorgeous and it’s not hard at all to set it up. But if you prefer our example you can always import it to your site and tweak it to your heart’s content. You can add more layers, change the colors and pictures or remove anything you don’t like.

The slider doesn’t have controls, you can change slides with the links on the with a mouse wheel.
